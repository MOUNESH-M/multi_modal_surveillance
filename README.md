# Multi-Modal Smart Surveillance System

A real-time intelligent surveillance system that integrates:
- **Object Detection** (YOLOv8)
- **Suspicious Object Alerts**
- **Real-time OCR (Text Extraction)**
- **Voice Alerts using Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

---

## Project Description
This project is a **multi-modal smart surveillance system** designed for real-time security applications. It uses **computer vision and natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to:
- Detect suspicious objects (like backpacks, knives, bottles, suitcases)
- Extract text from live video (OCR)
- Provide voice alerts when a suspicious object is detected

The system is built using **OpenCV, YOLOv8, Pytesseract, and pyttsx3.**
